To create a simple registration form using Java Swing, you'll typically make use of components such as JFrame, JPanel, JLabel, JTextField, JPasswordField, and JButton. Here's how you can design the layout:

Components Overview:
JFrame: The main window or frame that holds all components.
JPanel: A container to group other components like labels, text fields, and buttons.
JLabel: Used to display text that labels a field, like "Username" or "Password".
JTextField: An input field for text data like a name or email.
JPasswordField: An input field for password data (hidden characters).
JButton: A button that users can click to submit the form or clear it.

Frame Setup:

setTitle("User Registration Form"): Sets the title of the window.
setSize(350, 300): Specifies the width and height of the frame.
setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE): Ensures the application exits when the window is closed.
Panel and Layout:

JPanel panel = new JPanel(): Creates a panel to hold all the components.
panel.setLayout(new GridLayout(6, 2, 10, 10)): Uses a grid layout with 6 rows and 2 columns for label-textfield pairs.
Form Fields:

For each field (e.g., First Name, Email), we create a JLabel and corresponding JTextField or JPasswordField.
Buttons:

Submit Button: The action listener checks if all fields are filled and validates if the password matches the confirmation.
Clear Button: Clears all the text fields when clicked.
